./scripts/start-workflow.sh
# Choose: Simple complexity, Star topology, 3-4 agents
# Focus on: Concept → Blueprint → Implementation
```

### Small Team (Medium Projects)
```bash
# Standard setup for 1-3 month projects
./scripts/start-workflow.sh
# Choose: Medium complexity, Hierarchical topology, 5-6 agents
# Follow: Complete 6-phase workflow
```

### Large Team (Complex Projects)
```bash
# Comprehensive setup for 3+ month projects
./scripts/start-workflow.sh
# Choose: Complex complexity, Mesh topology, 7-8 agents
# Include: Extended validation and quality gates
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Phase Discipline
- **Complete each phase** before moving to the next
- **Validate artifacts** with stakeholders and technical experts
- **Document decisions** and rationale in version control
- **Use AI guidance** but maintain human oversight

### 2. Agent Coordination
- **Spawn agents in parallel** for maximum efficiency
- **Use Claude Flow memory** for cross-agent communication
- **Monitor agent performance** and adjust as needed
- **Maintain clear agent roles** and responsibilities

### 3. Quality Gates
- **Validate requirements** with real users when possible
- **Review architecture** with technical experts
- **Test early and often** throughout development
- **Maintain security** and performance standards

## Troubleshooting

### Common Setup Issues

#### Claude Flow MCP Not Configured
```bash
# Configure Claude Flow MCP
claude mcp add claude-flow npx claude-flow mcp start

# Verify configuration
claude mcp list | grep claude-flow
```

#### Project Directory Issues
```bash
# Ensure you're in the correct directory
pwd
ls -la project.json

# Check project configuration
cat project.json | grep -E "(name|complexity|current_phase)"
```

#### Git Repository Issues
```bash
# Initialize git if needed
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Check git status
git status
```

### Performance Optimization
