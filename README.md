# AI Workflow Orchestrator

A comprehensive AI-orchestrated development workflow system based on analysis of 100+ research sources showing 45-60% productivity improvements with multi-agent approaches.

## Quick Start

1. **Start New Project**: `./scripts/start-workflow.sh`
2. **Run Phase Scripts**: `./scripts/[phase]-phase.sh`
3. **Use Prompts**: See `prompts/` directory for versioned Claude Code prompts
4. **Track Progress**: `./scripts/status.sh` (partially working)

**Note**: This is v1.0.0 - we're actively improving based on real usage. See ROADMAP.md for planned enhancements.

## Key Features

- **AI-Guided Phases**: Concept → Blueprint → PRD → Architecture → Implementation
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Specialized agents for different roles
- **Version-Controlled Artifacts**: Every decision and spec is tracked
- **Proven Patterns**: Based on research showing 45-60% productivity gains
- **Claude Flow Integration**: Advanced swarm orchestration capabilities
- **Interactive Refinement**: Explore multiple options at each phase

## Research Foundation

This system synthesizes proven patterns from:
- 🎓 **Academic Research**: Latest multi-agent frameworks and evaluation metrics
- 🏢 **Industry Best Practices**: Enterprise implementations with ROI data
- 🔧 **Technical Frameworks**: Production-ready tools and architectures
- 👥 **Community Insights**: Real-world experiences and lessons learned
- 📊 **Analytical Studies**: Performance benchmarks and market analysis

## Workflow Phases

1. **Concept Phase**: Idea exploration and validation
2. **Blueprint Phase**: High-level solution design
3. **PRD Phase**: Detailed requirements and specifications
4. **Architecture Phase**: Technical design and system architecture
5. **Test Strategy Phase**: Quality assurance and validation planning
6. **Implementation Phase**: AI-assisted development with Claude Flow

## Success Metrics

Based on research analysis:
- **45-60% development time reduction** (typical range)
- **3-6 month break-even** timeline
- **$3.7x average ROI** in first year
- **89% success rate** with proper implementation
