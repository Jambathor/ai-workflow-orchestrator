# AI Workflow Orchestrator - Development Roadmap

## Vision
Create a robust, AI-powered development workflow framework that consistently delivers 45-60% productivity improvements through structured phases and intelligent agent coordination.

## Current State (v1.0.0)
- ✅ Basic 6-phase structure defined
- ✅ Concept phase templates and script
- ✅ Research-backed methodology
- ⚠️ Limited phase scripts
- ⚠️ Weak phase boundaries
- ⚠️ Manual prompt management

## Critical Fixes (v1.0.1) - URGENT

### 1. Decision Logging Automation
- [ ] Update ALL phase instructions with explicit logging code
- [ ] Add decision templates with actual code examples
- [ ] Create decision logging validation
- [ ] Test with real projects

### 2. Phase Completion Automation
- [ ] Update ALL phase instructions to update project.json
- [ ] Add explicit Python code for status updates
- [ ] Include artifact listing in completion
- [ ] Add reminder to use complete-phase.py script

### 3. Meta-Task Instructions
- [ ] Create explicit "bookkeeping" sections in all phases
- [ ] Add code snippets for all configuration updates
- [ ] Validate that updates actually happen
- [ ] Consider creating MCP tools for these tasks

## Short-term Goals (v1.1.0) - Next 2 weeks

### 1. Complete Phase Scripts
- [x] Create remaining phase scripts (prd, architecture, testing, implementation)
- [ ] Add phase validation logic to all scripts
- [ ] Implement automatic artifact tracking
- [ ] Add phase completion scripts

### 2. Human-in-the-Loop Features (NEW - High Priority)
- [ ] Add approval gates within phases
- [ ] Create interactive decision points
- [ ] Implement "pause for review" functionality
- [ ] Add section-by-section progression
- [ ] Enable mid-phase modifications
- [ ] Create interactive prompts for choices

### 2. Strengthen Phase Boundaries
- [ ] Add phase guards to all templates
- [ ] Create phase-specific agent constraints
- [ ] Implement phase transition validation
- [ ] Add "phase police" checks in scripts

### 3. Prompt Management System
- [ ] Version all prompts in `/prompts` directory
- [ ] Create prompt template system
- [ ] Add prompt validation
- [ ] Generate phase-specific prompts automatically

### 4. Improve Status Tracking
- [ ] Fix progress calculation in status.sh
- [ ] Add artifact validation
- [ ] Create visual progress indicators
- [ ] Add time tracking per phase

## Medium-term Goals (v1.2.0) - Next month

### 1. Enhanced Claude Flow Integration
- [ ] Create swarm templates per phase
- [ ] Add memory persistence patterns
- [ ] Implement cross-phase memory transfer
- [ ] Add swarm performance metrics

### 2. Project Templates
- [ ] Create starter templates for common project types
- [ ] Add complexity-based customization
- [ ] Include domain-specific patterns
- [ ] Pre-configured swarm topologies

### 3. Quality Gates
- [ ] Automated phase completion validation
- [ ] Quality metrics per phase
- [ ] Stakeholder approval workflows
- [ ] Rollback mechanisms

### 4. Developer Experience
- [ ] Interactive CLI improvements
- [ ] Better error messages
- [ ] Progress notifications
- [ ] Phase transition wizard

## Long-term Goals (v2.0.0) - Next quarter

### 1. AI Learning System
- [ ] Capture successful patterns
- [ ] Train on completed projects
- [ ] Suggest optimizations
- [ ] Predict common issues

### 2. Enterprise Features
- [ ] Multi-project orchestration
- [ ] Team collaboration tools
- [ ] Audit trails
- [ ] Compliance frameworks

### 3. Integration Ecosystem
- [ ] GitHub Actions integration
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline templates
- [ ] IDE plugins
- [ ] API for external tools

### 4. Advanced Analytics
- [ ] Productivity metrics dashboard
- [ ] ROI calculations
- [ ] Bottleneck identification
- [ ] Performance optimization suggestions

## Immediate Actions (This Week)

1. **Fix Current Issues**
   - [x] Create blueprint-phase.sh
   - [ ] Fix project directory issue in start-workflow.sh
   - [ ] Add prompt versioning system
   - [ ] Update status calculation

2. **Enhance Documentation**
   - [ ] Create video walkthrough
   - [ ] Add troubleshooting guide
   - [ ] Document best practices
   - [ ] Create FAQ

3. **Validate Approach**
   - [ ] Complete portfolio project through all phases
   - [ ] Document learnings at each phase
   - [ ] Refine based on experience
   - [ ] Update templates with learnings
