# Blueprint Phase Prompt

## Version: 1.0.0
## Last Updated: 2024-07-25
## Status: Pending Validation

## Prompt

```
Please follow @BLUEPRINT_PHASE_INSTRUCTIONS.md to complete the BLUEPRINT PHASE ONLY.

Use the validated concept "PortfoliOS" from @phases/concept/concept-validated.md as your input.

Remember:
- This is BLUEPRINT phase - high-level architecture only
- NO implementation code
- NO detailed technical specs
- Focus on system design, user journeys, and technology selection
- Create all required blueprint documents in phases/blueprint/

The blueprint should answer HOW we'll build PortfoliOS at a high level, not the actual building.
```

## Usage Notes
- Used after running blueprint-phase.sh script
- Requires completed concept phase artifacts
- Input: Validated concept from concept phase
- Output: 6 blueprint phase documents
