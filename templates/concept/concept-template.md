## AI Agent Coordination

### Claude Flow Integration
```bash
# Initialize concept exploration swarm
mcp__claude-flow__swarm_init --topology mesh --maxAgents 5

# Spawn specialized agents
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn --type researcher --name "Market Research"
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn --type analyst --name "Feasibility Analysis"
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn --type strategist --name "Business Strategy"
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn --type coordinator --name "Concept Lead"

# Orchestrate concept exploration
mcp__claude-flow__task_orchestrate --task "Concept Validation" --strategy parallel
```

### Memory Storage
```bash
# Store concept decisions
mcp__claude-flow__memory_usage --action store --key "concept/decisions" --value "{decisions}"

# Store stakeholder analysis
mcp__claude-flow__memory_usage --action store --key "concept/stakeholders" --value "{stakeholders}"

# Store feasibility assessment
mcp__claude-flow__memory_usage --action store --key "concept/feasibility" --value "{assessment}"
```

## Version Control

### Branch Strategy
- **Main Branch**: `main`
- **Concept Branch**: `concept/v1.0.0`
- **Exploration Branches**: `concept/exploration-1`, `concept/exploration-2`

### Commit Strategy
- Commit after each major section completion
- Tag decision points: `concept-v1.0.0-decision-point-1`
- Link commits to specific AI agent outputs

### Artifact Management
- All AI conversations saved as versioned artifacts
- Decision rationale captured in commit messages
- Alternative approaches documented in separate branches

## Template Usage Instructions

1. **Start with AI Analysis**: Use the provided agent prompts to explore your concept
2. **Iterative Refinement**: Run multiple analysis rounds to refine understanding
3. **Stakeholder Validation**: Engage real stakeholders to validate assumptions
4. **Document Decisions**: Capture all decisions and rationale in version control
5. **Prepare for Blueprint**: Ensure all transition criteria are met before moving to next phase

## Success Patterns (Based on Research)
